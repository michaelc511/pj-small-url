# URL Shortener API 

1. Make sure to have the frontend version running. Repo: https://github.com/michaelc511/pj-small-url-fe
2. To set up, run 'npm i'
3. To run, you would need the .env file for the MongoDB Atlas database from me which is not included in the Github repo for security. To start, type in 'npm start' and use the local url provided to test on Postman.
